## Sample selection: 

Pf7_fws.txt: Fws estimates per sample from Pf7. 
*.clusters.0.25.txt: hmmIBD clonal clusters from population samples. Choose single representative sample from clusters in pf7_filtering. 

## VCF filtering: 

- PlasmoDB-31_Pfalciparum3D7_gene_coord_CORE_ONLY.bed: bed file with genes falling in the core region. This can be subset to include genes of interest listed in txt files. 
- gene_sets_all.txt: Includes all core genes in the MCA SS2 assay. 
- ffd_codon_changes.txt: File listing FFD codon changes (as annotated by SNPSift) for custom script filtering VCF-encoded FFD variants.
